## Usage

The website was created using the Bootstrap library and its styling features. Additionally, to enhance the design's uniqueness, I introduced custom styling in the CSS folder.The navigation features a hamburger menu(visible when the device with is 575px or less).Moreover, the contact section provides convenient links to social media channels and a direct email option for easy communication

Explore different screen size views here:

<div style="text-align:left;">
  <p float="left">
  <img src="./images/desktop.png" alt="desktopsize view" height="500px" width="400px" style="margin-right: 20px;"/>
  <img src="./images/Mobile.PNG" alt="max 600px view"height="300px" width="150px"/>
</div>

**Note**: This is an initial version, and I plan to add more project links to the work section.
